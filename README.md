## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with CSS Flexbox.
To make the code neater, I learned how to externally link my css file.

Some code snippets on how I got the experience:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```
```css
.wrapper {
  max-width: 375px;
  margin: 100px auto;
}

.content {
  padding: 20px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 20px;
  padding: 15px 5px 25px 5px;
  background: #fff;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to focus more on building with frameworks like React.js
